        <h1>asynchronously update the form from server</h1>
        Traditionally, the only way to send POST requests was to use a form with its method attribute set to<br>
        post . Then, the data contained in the form was sent in a POST request to the URL specified in the<br>
        action attribute. Further complicating matters was the fact that a typical form submission navigates the<br>
        page to the new URL. This completely defeats the purpose of Ajax. Thankfully, there is a very easy<br>
        workaround in the form of a little-known attribute called target .<br>
        Workaround for post,  target = "_self" or id of frame.
	<form action="post.php" target="hidden" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="nameT" id ="name">
	<input type="submit" value="Add to Server Array">
	</form>
	<h1 id="header"></h1> 
	<iframe src="about:blank" id="hidden" name="hidden" height="30px"></iframe>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
	global_name_array=[];
	check = "";
	function updateHere() {
		document.getElementById("header").innerHTML = global_name_array;
	}
</script>
